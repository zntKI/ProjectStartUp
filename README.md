## Overview

A 3D split-screen co-op game, in which there are two main tasks - cooking and hunting, but in Hell :). Players receive orders from clients and they have to fulfill them in time in order to gain valuable points that influence their end score. To do that, firstly, they will need to hunt monsters that if neutralized, drop ingredients used later for preparing the ordered dish. Secondly, once the ingredients have been gathered, players can start cooking them, however they are not normal ingredients - they do not hold back: they act against you in various ways with the sole purpose of slowing the players down from their cooking.

A legendary hunter kills a powerful beast in a remote forest. What appears to be an ordinary animal, is an ancient creature possessed by a dark force, making it a prized possession of Lucifer. The hunter, unaware of its significance, takes the creature’s meat to his friend, a renowned chef, to create a unique dish. As they prepare the meal, the kitchen shakes violently. The ground cracks open, and they are both dragged into the fiery depths of Hell. A voice echoes around them. “I am Lucifer. You’ve killed my prized possession. For this, you must face the consequences.” Lucifer offers them a deal: if they can create dishes worthy of each of Hell’s circles, they may escape. The hunter must track and defeat Hell’s most fearless and warmonger monsters to gather cursed ingredients, while the chef transforms them into exquisite meals. Only by defeating each circle’s boss with a perfect dish can they move forward. But the final challenge is no other than Lucifer himself. Only a meal truly worthy of the Devil will grant them freedom.
